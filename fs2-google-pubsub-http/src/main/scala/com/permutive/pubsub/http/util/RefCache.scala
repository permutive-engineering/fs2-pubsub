    * Caches a single instance of type `A` for a period of time before refreshing it automatically.
    *
    * The time between refreshes is dynamic and based on the value of each `A` itself. This is similar to
    * [[RefreshableEffect]] except that only exposes a fixed refresh frequency.
    *
    * An old value is only made unavailable _after_ a new value has been acquired. This means that the time each value
    * is exposed for is `cacheDuration` plus the time to evaluate `fa`.
    *
    * @param fa                    generate a new value of `A`
    * @param cacheDuration         how long to cache a newly generated value of `A` for, if an effect is needed to
    *                              calculate this it should be part of `fa`
    * @param backgroundFailureHook what to do if retrying to refresh the value fails, up to user handle failing their
    *                              service, the refresh fiber will have stopped at this point

    *                              period that will be waited before the next new value
